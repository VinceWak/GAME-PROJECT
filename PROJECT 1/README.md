# Lab | Project 1

## Introduction

We are writing a code to be able to generate a strong random password that contains at least one of eacht character like : 
- Lower case
- Upper case
- Number
- Special character 

## Getting Started

Pseudocode

Define seperate lists for lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters.

Define a global list containing each individual character list

Define an empty password list that we wish to populate with the password

Define the length of password (n * the number of character lists)

For each individual character list in global list, randomly select a character. (Loop)

Append each character to our password list.

For n times repeat this process (Loop)

Break when i = (n * the number of character lists)

Print password
